                      So for this submission I had to cut a few corners and really focus on the most overlying issues, 
                      those being the "DIV soups" I have a habit of using and the lack of semantic elements.
                      The second issue that I wanted to address on this submission was the metatags and microformatting.
                      Then the next order of business was general 'quality of life' improvements such as editing fonts, color schemes, and the dynamic animations.

                    <main class="column right">
                      <article class="text"> 
  
                      <span class="typing-3">
  
                      </span>
  
                      </article>



                   
                      <p>
                        Another aspect I had to reconsider was making things a lot more ordered, structured and most importantly, consistent. 
                        In terms of the colors and overall layout I wanted to really commit to the whole Matrix theme. 
                        So to do so I wanted to make things look exactly how a Matrix website would be styled, 
                        and so I had to consider how best to design the website around the aesthetics of the Matrix while in-keeping with the conventions of modern websites.

                    <main class="column right">
                      <article class="text"> 
  
                      <span class="typing-3">
  
                      </span>
  
                      </article>


                      <div class="style">
                      <img src="classicSite2.jpg" alt="screenshot of classic site">
                      </div>


                    
                      <p>
                        As an interesting side-note the two screenshots are taken directly from the official Matrix website released in 1999, 
                        as a marketing tool to get people to answer the age old question, "What is The Matrix?". Digressions aside, 
                        one thing I really considered here was the use of fonts and colors and how these create certain feelings with the audience. Intially upon getting feedback from my peers and tutors I identified one prevalent issue, 
                        the color, or rather lack thereof. So for this submission I was tempted to change the color scheme completely and opt for colors that weren't as high contrast.

                      <div class="pstyle">
                        However I decided against this as doing away with the iconic green and black duo just did not feel right, and more importantly it change the entire aesthetic and feeling of the site, moving it 
                        from a mysterious, intriguing piece to something more generic and making it look like a WIX template more than anything else. So I decided to keep the color scheme and instead work on refining the consistency across the site.
                        One of the aspects I decided to really emphasise more was the use of reds and blues, red more so. Thematically it ties into the movie (red pill or blue pill) but on a design and somewhat technical level it also relates to a subversion of sorts.
                        Traditionally red is seen as hazardous or someting to steer away from, here, I decided why not make use of this idea and intergrate it into my site so it functions as the direct opposite. So instead of blue being used as the button for accessing the site it is used here as a button for exiting, much like how the blue pill is an "exit" to the matrix
                        One of the aspects that I was not able to address with this submission was the issue of embedded stylesheets, due to time constraints I wanted to prioritize what I felt to be the most important issues.
